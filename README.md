# Daniel Rotter's dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles for [fish](http://fishshell.com), which I keep here mainly as a backup.

# Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:danrot/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Execute the fish installation script, which will create all necessary symlinks. It will skip paths already existing
with an error message:

```bash
~/.dotfiles/bootstrap
```
